# Clean Architecture Refactoring Summary

## What We've Done

Successfully refactored the workflow feature using Clean Architecture principles:

### 1. Domain Layer (Business Logic)
- `lib/domain/entities/workflow.sh` - Workflow entity with business rules
- `lib/domain/repositories/workflow_repository.sh` - Repository interface

### 2. Application Layer (Use Cases)
- `lib/application/workflows/create_workflow.sh` - Create workflow use case
- `lib/application/workflows/run_workflow.sh` - Run workflow use case

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (External Dependencies)
- `lib/infrastructure/repositories/sqlite_workflow_repository.sh` - SQLite implementation

### 4. Presentation Layer (UI)
- `lib/presentation/cli_router.sh` - Command routing and formatting
- `bin/termbrain-clean` - Minimal entry point

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Business logic is independent of storage mechanism
   - Easy to swap SQLite for another database
   - UI logic separated from business logic

2. **Testability**
   - Each layer can be tested independently
   - Mock implementations easy to create
   - Business rules tested without database

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear file structure
   - Single responsibility per file
   - Easy to understand flow

4. **Extensibility**
   - New features don't affect existing code
   - Easy to add new storage backends
   - Simple to add new UI formats

## Comparison

### Before (Monolithic)
```bash
lib/workflows.sh (227 lines)
- Mixed database, business logic, and presentation
- Hard to test individual parts
- Tightly coupled to SQLite
```

### After (Clean Architecture)
```bash
domain/entities/workflow.sh (87 lines) - Pure business logic
domain/repositories/workflow_repository.sh (29 lines) - Interface
application/workflows/create_workflow.sh (33 lines) - Use case
application/workflows/run_workflow.sh (67 lines) - Use case  
infrastructure/repositories/sqlite_workflow_repository.sh (119 lines) - Database
presentation/cli_router.sh (125 lines) - UI logic
bin/termbrain-clean (38 lines) - Entry point
```

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Refactoring**
   - Apply same pattern to command recording
   - Refactor AI context generation
   - Move statistics to clean architecture

2. **Add Tests**
   - Unit tests for each layer
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Mock repository for testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Document each layer's responsibilities
   - Create developer guide
   - Add inline documentation

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Longest file**: 125 lines (was 745)
- **Clear dependencies**: Each file imports only what it needs
- **Testable**: Can test business logic without database
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features

This refactoring demonstrates that Clean Architecture can work well even for shell scripts, providing better organization and maintainability.
