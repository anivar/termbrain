## Coding Standards

### Rust Guidelines

1. **Follow Rust idioms**
   - Use `Result<T, E>` for error handling
   - Prefer `?` operator over `unwrap()`
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Document public APIs

2. **Error Handling**
   ```rust
   // Good
   let file = File::open(path)?;
   
   // Bad
   let file = File::open(path).unwrap();
   ```

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep modules focused and cohesive
   - Use the type system effectively
   - Minimize `unsafe` code
   - Add tests alongside implementation

### Documentation

1. **Code Comments**
   - Document "why" not "what"
   - Use `///` for public API docs
   - Include examples in doc comments

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Keep first line under 50 characters
   - Reference issues: "Fix #123: Description"
   - Use conventional commits when possible:
     - `feat:` New features
     - `fix:` Bug fixes
     - `docs:` Documentation changes
     - `test:` Test additions/changes
     - `refactor:` Code refactoring
     - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test edge cases
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Keep tests focused and independent

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test real workflows
   - Verify shell integration
   - Test error scenarios

Example:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_command_validation_rejects_empty() {
        let result = validate_command("");
        assert!(result.is_err());
    }
}
```
