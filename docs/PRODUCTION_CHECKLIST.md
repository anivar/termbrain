- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Add circuit breakers for external dependencies

### ❌ Configuration Management
- [ ] Fix config loading (currently returns defaults only)
- [ ] Support configuration file locations
- [ ] Validate configuration on startup
- [ ] Support environment variable overrides

### ❌ Database Management
- [ ] Implement proper migration system
- [ ] Add database version tracking
- [ ] Support rollback procedures
- [ ] Add backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Implement data retention policies

### ❌ Resource Management
- [ ] Add connection pool limits
- [ ] Implement query timeouts
- [ ] Add memory usage limits
- [ ] Prevent unbounded growth

## High Priority Issues

### ⚠️ Security
- [ ] Add security contact information
- [ ] Implement secrets detection and masking
- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Support key rotation
- [ ] Add rate limiting

### ⚠️ Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Support distributed tracing
- [ ] Add performance profiling

### ⚠️ Testing
- [ ] Increase test coverage (target: >80%)
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add security tests
- [ ] Add chaos testing

## Medium Priority Issues

### 📊 Performance
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add query result caching
- [ ] Implement batch operations
- [ ] Add index optimization
- [ ] Profile memory usage

### 📦 Deployment
- [ ] Create Docker images
- [ ] Add Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Support multi-architecture builds
- [ ] Add systemd service files
- [ ] Create installation packages

### 📚 Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Add operational runbooks
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document security model

## Low Priority Issues

### 🎨 User Experience
- [ ] Add command suggestions
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search
- [ ] Add interactive mode improvements
- [ ] Support custom themes
- [ ] Add shell completions

### 🔧 Maintenance
- [ ] Add self-diagnostic tools
- [ ] Implement automatic cleanup
- [ ] Add update notifications
- [ ] Support plugin system
- [ ] Add telemetry (opt-in)

## Production Deployment Prerequisites

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. **All critical issues are resolved**
2. **Security audit completed**
3. **Performance testing passed**
4. **Documentation complete**
5. **Monitoring configured**
6. **Backup strategy implemented**
7. **Incident response plan created**
8. **Load testing completed**

## Estimated Timeline

Based on current assessment:
- **Critical fixes**: 3-4 weeks
- **High priority**: 2-3 weeks
- **Medium priority**: 2-3 weeks
- **Total to production**: 7-10 weeks

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Data Loss**: No backup/restore functionality
2. **Security**: Missing security features
3. **Stability**: Unwrap calls can cause panics
4. **Performance**: No resource limits

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Implement comprehensive testing
2. Add monitoring before deployment
3. Deploy in stages with rollback plan
4. Regular security audits

## Sign-off Requirements

Production deployment requires sign-off from:
- [ ] Engineering Lead
- [ ] Security Team
- [ ] Operations Team
- [ ] Product Owner
